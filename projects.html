                This page briefly presents various projects I'm working on or I've worked on.

                <h2>LC</h2>
                This is the project I spend most of my time these days. <br/>
                It is the compiler I build for my PhD and I used as a research tool for some years now. <br/>
                It is not intended to be used in production and must instead be considered as a buggy(-woogie)
                but unique tool I use, with a lot of fun, to explore the JIT compilation world. <br/>
                LC is an optimizing JIT compiler for Scheme written in Scheme using new JIT compilation techniques presented in some research papers.<br/>
                LC officially stands for <i>Lazy Compiler</i> but also for <i>Le Compilateur</i> that means <i>The Compiler</i> in French. <br/>
                Unfortunately, I spend less time on it since the beginning of 2019 because I'm focusing on writing my PhD dissertation.

                <h2>Timbit</h2>
                Timbit is an attempt to build a new Scheme implementation from scratch that secretely wants to be the successor of LC. <br/>
                For now, Timbit is slow because it is an interpreter and is not optimized. <br/>
                It is written in C++ and uses an intermediate representation that is designed for the purpose of becoming a generic bytecode for dynamic languages. <br/>
                Unlike LC, it features a REPL and is intended to be used for real programs instead of being a research tool. <br/>
                Timbit follows the Scheme implementation names tradition (like the Orbit, Rabbit and Gambit compilers). <br/>
                It is named for these <a>small sweet balls</a>.
